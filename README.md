# Quiz Project


**About**

A simple quiz site which allows users to complete quizzes on a number of different topics.

The question data is stored in a Javascript array of objects in the questionData.js file.


**Purpose**

The site is built with a combination of html, css, and javascript.

I built this to reinforce the following key concepts:

- DOM manipulation
- Timers using setInterval() and clearInterval()
- Javascript Array methods
- EventListeners
- Modal Display and Modal Content Generation
- Responsive Design Principles
